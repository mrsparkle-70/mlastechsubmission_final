# mlastechsubmission_final
Hello guys ! This is my first Submission and deployment website for a tech event Selection. 
I have made a welcome website for registration for the Flagship Offline event of Jadavpur University "THE ML Accelerator Summit 2.0"
I used HTML , CSS , Javascript, Bootstrap for the Frontend development.
I used Php , mysql for the backend integration for secured login system by user.
Unfortunately, The login feature will not be avaliable for the First release, since there are some issuing regarding deployment of php files on server hosting.
Thank you all seniors and coordinating members for guiding me through the process.
